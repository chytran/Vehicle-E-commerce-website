# Vehicle-E-commerce-website
A school senior project that requires the usage of java servlets and the understanding on how web.xml works in order to construct an eccomerce website solely for vehicles. In addition, it requires the usage of SQL Workbench to store all of our data and display them onto our website by using jdbc connection. By implementing the jdbc connection, displaying vehicles, prices, and images, users can see the numerous options of vehicles available for purchase. There is a shopping card in addition that allows users to update the quantity of vehicles that they want, and they are able to remove certain products if requested. Also, there is a checkout section in which it will send a confirmation email to the user's email about their order confirmation.
